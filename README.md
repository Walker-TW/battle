An app to simulate an online game in which two competing "players" fight and their HP is removed when 'attacked'. Players are instantiated through classes and all of the game is controlled through a 'Game' class.

Has also been split using the MVC model to ensure that I keep Seperation of Concerns between the various portions of the program.

Multiplayer has been added which allows both players to switch turns and to attack each other. 

Built using Ruby, Sinatra and Capybara (for testing).
